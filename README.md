# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipelines – Portfolio

This repository contains **template-based CI/CD pipelines** designed with reusability, modularity, and security in mind. All workflows are built using GitHub Actions and follow AWS best practices for deploying Dockerized applications via ECR and ECS.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `monorepo/` – Multi-service architecture with change detection
- `multi-env/` – Branch-based (dev/prod) deployments with caching
- `single-repo/` – Minimal pipelines for isolated services

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✅ **Reusable Templates**: Each workflow is designed as a portable template — copy-paste ready for different projects.
- 🔒 **Secrets-Based Configuration**: All environment values are expected to be passed via GitHub Secrets. No credentials or hardcoded values exist in the YAML files.
- 🧱 **Modular Build Steps**: Built primarily using `uses:` syntax from GitHub’s official and community actions, instead of manual shell commands.
- 🔁 **Rolling Deployments**: All ECS deployments are done via `rolling update` strategy for zero-downtime releases.
- 🕒 **Versioned Image Tagging with Timestamps**: Docker images are tagged using timestamp-based versions (e.g., `20250808T152045`) instead of `latest`, ensuring reliable rollbacks and avoiding deployment collisions. This creates a deterministic deployment history across ECR and ECS.

## 🚀 Included Pipelines

### 1. Single Repo – ECS Deployment

- Detects changes on the `master` branch
- Builds Docker image from project root
- Pushes image to Amazon ECR
- Updates ECS task definition
- Triggers rolling deployment to ECS service

---

### 2. Multi-Environment – Dev/Prod ECS Deployments

- Deploys based on the target branch (`main` → production, `dev` → development)
- Separate ECR repositories, task definitions, and ECS services per environment
- Supports Docker build caching for faster deployment (especially Bun & Next.js apps)
- Ideal for frontend/backend workflows where build size matters

### 3. Monorepo – Change Detection & Reusable Workflow

- Detects which specific folder/service was changed
- Triggers deployment only for affected service(s)
- Built using centralized reusable workflows
- Two alternative strategies available:
  - **Static Job-Based**: Each service has its own deployment job with conditional logic
  - **Matrix-Based**: Uses a matrix to dynamically loop through services, reducing code duplication and improving scalability
- Easily extensible for large microservice setups

## 📌 Notes

- 🚫 **Sensitive Data Masked**: All names, secrets, repository paths, and container IDs have been altered to prevent any data leakage.
- ♻️ **Easily Reusable**: You can reuse any pipeline by replacing the service name, ECR repo, ECS settings, and GitHub secrets.
- ⚙️ **Built for Production**: All pipelines have been tested and used in real deployment scenarios with active ECS clusters and services.
- 🔁 **Built-In Rollback Friendly**: Each deploy creates a unique ECS task definition revision and timestamp-tagged Docker image. ECS automatically preserves a full version history, enabling seamless rollback to any previous state without requiring custom tooling or external version tracking.
